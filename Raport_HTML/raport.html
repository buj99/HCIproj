      <p>
        Pathological gambling, also known as compulsive gambling or disordered gambling, is a recognized mental disorder characterized by a pattern of continued gambling despite negative physical, psychological, and social consequences.

      <h2><span>2. </span>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Pathological gambling (PG) is a relatively common disorder associated with significant personal, familial, and social costs. The condition is currently classified as an impulse control disorder, although similarities exist with other disorders, particularly substance addictions. By definition, gambling is considered placing something of value at risk in the hope of gaining something of greater value. It involves decision making based on the assessment of relative risk and reward. Since this process involves a set of cognitive skills that are central to most aspects of life, it has remained a resilient component of human experience. In most cases, gambling involves risking money, and conventional forms of gambling involve lotteries, card games, horse and dog racing, sports betting, and slot machines. Internet gambling is a newer phenomenon, which has gained a wide following and whose revenues are projected to reach $125 billion by 2010. Research on PG over the past decade has provided greater insight into the biological features of this disorder and has made possible an expanding set of effective behavioral and pharmacological treatments.

        This project is supposed to enable a simple way for humans to detect and to help people if they suffer of pathological gambling.
        How is this working? You write in the form your reddit username and click submit. The algorithm is checking
        their posts and is searching for patterns, similar with the data it was trained into.
      </p>
      <p>
        Purpose of the algorithm:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>falls into the category of health </li>
        <li>it is made for every person that wants to be aware of this problem</li>
        <li>brings to the table a simple way of prediction of pathological gambling</li>
      </ul>
